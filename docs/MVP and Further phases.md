# **SEO Crawler – MVP Plan, Quality Gates & Release Roadmap**

This document outlines the execution phases beyond the POC: the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), quality gates, and phased release strategy. It defines what constitutes a production-worthy release, timelines for stabilization, and key deliverables at each phase.

## **1\. Goals**

\- Finalize and stabilize the production-ready crawler system post-POC  
\- Validate scalability, reliability, security, and maintainability  
\- Deliver value incrementally via milestone-based releases  
\- Define clear quality gates and metrics per phase

## **2\. Phases & Timeline**

Assumes 3–5 developers, full-time

### **Phase 1: MVP (4–6 weeks)**

* \- Language and library stack finalized (from POC)  
* \- Crawl 100K–500K URLs/day reliably  
* \- High-quality metadata \+ text extraction  
* \- Basic topic classification   
* \- robots.txt \+ token bucket \+ retry/DLQ system  
* \- Deduplication  
* \- Basic metrics and alerts, trace IDs  
* \- Simple UI/API for submitting batch jobs and viewing results

### **Phase 2: Hardening & Observability (3–4 weeks)**

* \- Security audit (SSRF, IAM, sandboxing)  
* \- Config service with feature flags and rollout control  
* \- Advanced dashboards (host health, retries, cost)  
* \- Latency SLOs (P50, P95), error budgets

### **Phase 3: Dynamic Content & Scale-out (4–6 weeks)**

* \- JavaScript rendering  
* \- Concurrency tuning under load  
* \- S3 lifecycle \+ storage tiering policies

## **3\. Quality Gates for MVP**

### **Correctness**

* \- ≥ 95% accuracy for title/meta/OG extraction on test corpus  
* \- ≥ 90% text clean-up accuracy for structured blocks

### **Throughput**

* \- ≥ 100K pages/day sustained crawl  
* \- ≤ 5 sec average fetch \+ extract latency per page

### **Robots & Politeness**

* \- 100% robots.txt compliance with respect to crawl-delay and disallow rules  
* \- No origin-block or HTTP 429 due to crawler behavior

### **Observability**

* \- All jobs and stages emit trace IDs and stage timings  
* \- DLQ ≤ 1% and auto-recoverable

### **Security & Stability**

* \- SSRF/DNS spoofing protection active  
* \- VPC-only fetchers; sandboxed rendering containers  
* \- Secrets encrypted at rest and in transit

### **Maintainability**

* \- Config service enables no-redeploy changes  
* \- Tests \> 85% coverage on core logic (fetch, extract, classify)
