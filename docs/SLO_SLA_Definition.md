# SLO & SLA Definitions

# **1\. Introduction**

This document defines the Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) for the SEO Crawler system. These metrics ensure that the system operates within defined boundaries of performance, reliability, and availability to support large-scale content processing use cases.

# **2\. Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)**

| Objective Area | SLO Metric | Target |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Availability | Service Uptime (HTTP 200 responses for API jobs) | ≥ 99.99% |
| Latency | Fetch \+ Extract latency (P95) | ≤ 5 seconds |
| Latency | Fetch \+ Extract latency (P50) | ≤ 2 seconds |
| Throughput | Batch job throughput | ≥ 100K URLs/day (MVP), ≥ 1M URLs/hour (scale) |
| Error Rate | DLQ entries as % of total URLs | ≤ 1% |
| Correctness | Title/meta/OG extraction accuracy | ≥ 95% |
| Security | SSRF & private IP mitigation active | 100% of requests |
| Observability | Trace-ID coverage in logs and metrics | ≥ 95% of processed URLs |

# **3\. Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**

| Service Aspect | SLA Commitment | Remediation or Escalation Policy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Availability | ≥ 99.9% monthly uptime | Investigate root cause; fix within 24h; monthly RCA shared |
| Job Completion | Batch job completes within SLA latency (1h for 1M URLs) | Auto-scaled retry and operator alert if \>10% variance |
| Security Compliance | Full compliance with SSRF, VPC isolation, and IAM scope | Security team notified; deployment rollback if breach detected |
| Data Freshness | Fetched pages processed within 10 minutes of ingest | Trigger incident alert if breach persists \>10 min |
| Misclassification | ≤ 5% false classification rate on gold sample | Model rollback or retraining initiated |

# **4\. Error Budget Policy**

The system uses a burn-rate-based error budget for controlling releases and prioritizing reliability work.  
\- If burn rate exceeds 25%, all non-critical deployments are paused.  
\- At 50% burn, all deployments are frozen; incident response team investigates root cause.  
\- At 75% or more, an RCA is mandated, and on-call rotations are extended for coverage.

# **5\. Monitoring & Alerting**

Monitoring includes dashboards for queue latency, DLQ rate, model accuracy drift, and per-stage throughput. Alerts are configured for key SLO violations, such as high DLQ rates, latency spikes, and classifier confidence drops. Observability is instrumented using OpenTelemetry, with logs, metrics, and traces indexed for triage and RCA workflows.
